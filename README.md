👍Hello, I am Nazlıcan Başkurt. I graduated from Kocaeli University with a bachelor's degree in Chemistry. I am improving myself in front-end and design fields. I am open to learning and follow technologies closely.

⏱I am currently actively learning React and developing a website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and webpack.

💻Even though I have added a lot to myself since the day I first started software, there are still many things I do not know, and my greatest passion is to research, learn and apply these subjects.

💖i love the software
